# CE - Tribal Boomspears

##### *This is a testing release, all feedback, ideas and balance discussion are highly welcome!*

Inspired by Mad-Max Fury Road and WW2 Asian anti-tank skills, we proudly want you the *Boomspears!*. 

Boomspears are throwable, highly dangerous both for users and for foes, explosive javelin designed to be a true alternative to stickbombs and molotovs. 
It is highly effective against armored pawns and mechs, at the cost of unprecise shots and a relatively dangerous range of use. 
Ennemies will come equipped with it so, be aware of that before they reach your walls and transform themselves, their friends and you into some bloody fireworks.

Imagine it as a pila with a homemade and rudimentary explosive charge at the end :

# FAQ 

**How to craft ?**

First research Gunpowder, and you can craft it at crafting spot or at any smithing bench.
You need some FSX, 1 steel slag, and some wood or some steel to craft them.

**Moh boomspear are OP !**

They are meant to pose a serious challenge to the player, since Tribals even in CE lacks real flavour and tools. Now they should be much more a threat as they should be.

**Can I use it as a melee weapon ?**

Yes.

**Vanilla ?**

No.

**Steam Workshop ?**

No.

**Do you have more plans to update the mod ?**

Yes, I plan to do EMP and Prometheum version of boomspears, and also add a way to repurpose a grenade into a boomspear.
I also do have plans for a more fleshed and sensitive Tribal rebalance and overhaul.
